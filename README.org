This is a set of tools to generate a Buddhabrot fractal on the GPU of
any size with any iteration count. It is designed in a way that the
runs can be combined to create a more complete image.

The GPU compute shaders are run using the WGPU library.

** gpu
This will run trials of Buddhabrot generation on the GPU and
periodically output them to zip files. This is done in order to make
the process both resume-able and able to be merged together into a
single output image. This can be run for any amount of time and
canceled with Ctrl-C.
#+begin_src 
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release --bin gpu -- -h
#+end_src

** merge
This program is designed to merge together a series of zip files from
the gpu program above into a single zip file. The reason for this is
to save time in the image program below since it essentially needs to
do the same processing to combine the zip files.
#+begin_src 
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release --bin merge -- -h
#+end_src

** image
This tool will generate a 16-bit PNG from the zip files generated by
the =gpu= and ~merge~ tools above. From there this PNG can be imported
into GIMP or Photoshop to modify the gamma or color levels as
necessary to produce as desirable image.
#+begin_src 
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release --bin image -- -h
#+end_src
